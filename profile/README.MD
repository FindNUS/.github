# FindNUS

Welcome to FindNUS. FindNUS is a lost and found item management system which aims to supplement existing NUS lost and found system in National University of Singapore (NUS) by reducing the barriers for item finders to submit an item online. As such, item losters are more likely to find an item which they have lost on top of items which only make it to the security personnel.
